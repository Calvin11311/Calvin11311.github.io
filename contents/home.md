#### Biography

My name is Calvin Chen. I got my bachelor Degree in computer science with Distinction at Nankai University in June 2025, and conducted research in the [Nankai CV Lab](https://cv.nankai.edu.cn).
<!-- supervised by Prof. [Zirui Liu](https://zirui-ray-liu.github.io/) and [Jiayi Yuan](https://jy-yuan.github.io/) (Ph.D. Candidate).  -->
<!-- In the summer of 2023, I visited [TsinghuaNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) and conducted research under Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), where I received invaluable mentorship from [Weilin Zhao](https://brawny-college-5b2.notion.site/Weilin-Zhao-11d20b7deb8280388213d5f5ed072992) (Ph.D. Candidate) and [Xu Han](https://thucsthanxu13.github.io/) (Research Assistant Professor), for which I am deeply grateful. -->

I have experience in computer vision (both Image Editing and Low-level vision) and Image Editing and LLMs, along with extensive industry research internship experience. 

<!-- This includes:

* Participating in the pretraining of the Yi-Lightning model at 01.AI.
* Contributing to ML Infra of the pretraining of the foundation model at ModelBest (with TsinghuaNLP).
* Participating in the finetuning of the CodeLLM [Raccoon](https://raccoon.sensetime.com/code) (Copilot-like) at SenseTime (with CUHK MMLab). -->
